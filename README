Simple routing engine for NODE JS. Makes use of Connect and Http modules. Goal is to have a server where you can simple define a JSON object with the key being a string representing the route, and the value being a function that needs to be called. If they function needs route data it will pass an object to that function after parsing the url containing the route data it needs. Right now it should return a string representing the processed results. Long term I don't want this to be another Express, but I want it to be a simple micro framework for prototyping RESTful APIs.
